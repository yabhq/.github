> A modern paradox is that it's simpler to create complex interfaces because it's so complex to simplify them.

## Design + Development

We're a team of designers and developers who are passionate about building products that solve real problems. We're not just a team of coders, we're a team of builders.

When we build a product, we start with the user interface and the features the users need to accomplish their goals. Our goal is to build a product that solves 80% of use cases, and abstract away the 20% of features that are not needed.
